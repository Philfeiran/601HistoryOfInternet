                        <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">Internet took over the world in 1993 from a couple of students and young nerds from the university of Illinois. These students were fascinated by worldwide network invented by an English scientist named Timothy John Berners-Lee
                            Being fascinated with the graphics and the fact that with a mouse click you can go anywhere these young students were try to promote a new of idea of implementing the first GUI. In order to do this they partnered with Jim Clark, a success business man from the Silicon Valley who understood business in technology. 
                            The group of students from Illinois moved to Silicon Valley and posted first GUI. It went from a toy for nerdy people and geeks to be used by a lot of people.
                            Now, on the other hand, Bill Gates and his big tech company had control over the tech business and Gates’ dream was to have people having access to computers and using his MS software. The problem was that the students from Illinois along with Jim Clark had already created the first graphical web browser named ‘MOSAIC’ and now they wanted to build a new web browser based on that and turn the internet into the future of commerce and communication. The internet age began and had nothing to do with Microsoft.
                            Now here is the problem big companies run software platforms and that’s the software where other programs run on top and Microsoft was upset that Netscape was booming even though they were using Microsoft platform and not getting any benefit from it. So, 
                            Microsoft  threatened Netscape to either let them buy Netscape or they will going to launch their own browser without them and make them disappear from the Silicon Valley.
                            In the end, Microsoft got away and AOL bought Netscape and, for this reason, the US government sued Gates and Microsoft accusing him of being a high tech terrorist. 
                            MS was accused of using its window monopoly to engage in a wide variety of predatorial and exclusionary business practices to prevent consumers from accessing Netscape products and put the pioneering startup 6 feet under. Microsoft was punished was told to be divided into 2 parts but later order was reversed because punishment was too harsh. </p>
