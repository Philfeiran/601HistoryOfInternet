                        <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">Internet is an electronic communication network that connects computer networks and organizational computer facilities around the world. It is used to communicate and share data with one another. Today, we use the internet for almost everything, and for many people it would be impossible to imagine life without it. 
                            Unlike technologies such as telephone, the internet has no “inventor.” It actually evolved over time. The internet got its start in the United States more than 50 years ago as a government weapon in the Cold War. For years, scientists and researchers used it to communicate and share data with one another.
                            In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world’s first manmade satellite into orbit. Even though the satellite did not do much the big Sputnik was proof of something alarming. Americans, on one hand had been designing bigger cars and better television sets while the Soviets were focused on things more useful such as creating satellites and Americans were afraid of losing the Cold War.
                            Scientists and military experts were especially concerned about what might happen in the event of a Soviet attack on the nation’s telephone system. For this reason, in 1965 a  M.I.T. scientist developed a way of sending information from one computer to another that he called “packet switching.” Packet switching breaks data down into blocks, or packets, before sending it to its destination. That way, each packet can take its own route from place to place. 
                            On October 29, 1969, ARPAnet delivered its first message: a “node-to-node” communication from one computer to another. (The first computer was located in a research lab at UCLA and the second was at Stanford; each one was the size of a small house.) The message—“LOGIN”—was short and simple, but it crashed the fledgling ARPA network anyway.
                            By the end of the 1970s, a computer scientist named Vinton Cerf had begun to solve this problem by developing a way for all of the computers on all of the world’s mini-networks to communicate with one another. He called his invention “Transmission Control Protocol,” or TCP. (Later, he added an additional protocol, known as “Internet Protocol.” The acronym we use to refer to these today is TCP/IP) and Cerf’s protocol transformed the internet into a worldwide network.</p>
