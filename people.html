                            People like Chad Hurley(YouTube Founder), Jay Adelson and Kevin Rose(Digg), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook)  realized that in today’s society we love the sound of our own voices rather than have media showing us what they think is right. We also have access to see anything we want as well as upload as many videos as we want. We live in a free society where technology plays an important role in matters of free expression.
                            Music also started to be distributed on the web Napster creator Shawn Fanning Surfed the web for downloadable music so he decided to create his own company. The way Napster worked was users allowed their PCs talk and exchange info music with other users as long as you had MP3. This create a lot of problems for singers and businesses in the music industry since people were not buying CDs from music stores and would prefer to download music for free from websites like Napster. Napster had set music free breaking the distribution monopoly exercised by the record business 
                            Facebook also took over the social media. It was created by a college student (Harvard dropout) Mark Zuckerberg. He created software then software catches on and takes the web by storm. Student moves out  to Silicon Valley climbs into bed with Venture capitalist and makes a lot of money. In Zuckerberg’s case his great ambition was to capture the totality of human connectiveness to create the ultimate relationship engine. Social graph is also known as social network analysis: the basic idea is that we are all bound together by a web of relationships.
                            Because of social media networks, we are now able to interact with thousands of people all over the world – this is why we see people who have thousands of Facebook friends or tens of thousands of Twitter followers. Without social media, that would be impossible. Social media networks allow us the opportunity to share opinions with a far wider audience.
