                        <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">After the World Wide Web was created  the next problem was how to use it in order to navigate it . This is where search engines such as google, yahoo and excite came to take part in the tech world. 
                            Two students from Stanford (Jerry Yang and David Filo) came up with the idea of creating a directory with a web user that can help you find cool stuff. They were trying to find different information with regards to basketball games and basketball players and decided to create a directory.  Michael Moritz, Venture Capitalist from Sequoia Capital visited these two Stanford students since he was interested in his ideas of finding ways to navigate the internet and invested money on the business.
                            Now the next question was what to used Yahoo for. The best answer was advertising  in order to make a profit. This new approach in 1995 showed us it was possible to make money on the web. The web boom had begun and with this tool there were new ways to make income. 
                            In 1996, Yahoo had a huge competence with Excite which apparently was more sophisticated. Excite was created by some Stanford students but their approaches to make money was not convincing.  They wanted to turn users into a captive audience for the benefit of advertising but they still struggle in finding better ways to search for the web
                            Google was created also by some Stanford students(Larry Page and Sergey Brin.) They had the idea of linking from one page to another is a recommendation. They wanted to organize all the info of the world and make it searchable and universally accessible.
                            Bill Gross Founder of Idealab came with a brilliant idea for making money. 
                            “When you search for something on the internet you are not searching for something that you are interested in, you are searching for something you are interested in buying”, (Gross). Bill Gross saw that a search engine could be the world’s powerful most efficient tool. Keywords are the future of the business since they are giving you a huge window to the mind of their intent at that moment. Google took his idea became richer and Gross sued them and later was compensated since Google stole his idea.</p>
